# Rust rules engine

Migration phase 4 (docs/RustMigration.md, issue #187): a rules engine in Rust for two-player duels with the Pioneer and
Standard Career school decks, built for the AI's search. Code: `rust/crates/playmat-engine`.

## What it has to match

Java stays the oracle. A **shadow game** is a game Java played: the decks, the state when the first player gets
priority (libraries top first, hands, the game's random state), every answer the players gave from then on, and the
trace (a state fingerprint at each priority and each resolution, [StateFingerprint.md](StateFingerprint.md)). The Rust
engine starts from the same state, gives the same answers to the same questions, and must give the same trace.

- `ShadowGamesTest` (Mage.Tests) records them: two human seats answered by the seeded `RandomDriver`, which picks what a
  client could send (lands, spells, targets, mana sources, attacks, blocks). The answers are the decision log's
  ([StateFingerprint.md](StateFingerprint.md), "Decision logs"): objects named by zone and position.
- `cargo test -p playmat-engine --test shadow` replays every game under `rust/crates/playmat-engine/shadow/` and fails
  if one differs. With `PLAYMAT_SHADOW=<dir>` it replays that folder instead and only reports (add
  `PLAYMAT_SHADOW_STRICT=1` to fail): per game, the first trace entry that differs, with Java's and Rust's texts.
  Games with a card the engine doesn't have, and games Java didn't finish (timeouts), are skipped.

Recording games (Mage.Tests; `mvn -o -q install -pl Mage -DskipTests` first if Mage changed):

    mvn -o -pl Mage.Tests test -Dtest=ShadowGamesTest -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false \
      -Dxmage.shadowGames=<out dir> -Dxmage.shadowGames.games=30 \
      -Dxmage.shadowGames.decks=$PWD/rust/crates/playmat-engine/shadow-decks/tier1 \
      -Dxmage.dataCollectors.printGameLogs=false -Dlog4j.configuration=file:$PWD/.travis/log4j.properties

Without `.decks` it plays the Pioneer and Standard school decks. With `-Dxmage.shadowGames.replay=<dir>` (and
`-Dtest='ShadowGamesTest#replayShadowGames'`) it plays the games in that folder again from their decks, seed and
answers, and writes them with Java's trace now: for checked-in games whose answers were edited after Java stopped
asking a question (#265's empty target prompts). Answers that name a mode or a choice by object id can't be replayed. The checked-in games have their trace texts removed
to keep them small; a recording keeps them, which is what the difference report prints.

`HumanDialogs.md` is the question-by-question reference for what `HumanPlayer` asks.

A full game replays in about 2.5 ms (release build). Cleanup gives priority only when 514.3a applies, as Java's `EndPhase` does.

Triggers that fire on the same event wait in Java's `TriggeredAbilities` order, which is the order cards were loaded
into the game (tokens after every card), not the order they entered. Shadow games record each card's place in it
(`libraryTriggerOrder`, `handTriggerOrder`); a player orders their own waiting triggers with PICK_ABILITY by their
place in that list.

Triggered abilities are one engine class, `TriggeredAbility`, with what it triggers on (`on`: enters, attacks, dies,
a permanent of a filter entering, dying or attacking, attacking with N creatures, leaving the battlefield, the
beginning of a step, a spell cast, a card drawn, life gained, damage to a player or an opponent) beside its effects and targets; the transpiler turns each Java trigger class into it and keeps the Java name
to line it up with the facts.

Classes a card file declares for itself (Kavaron Harrier's effect, Master of Barbs' trigger) are written by hand in
the transpiler's `CUSTOM` table as the engine classes that do the same.

## The 10,000-game gate run (11–12 Nov 2026)

Phase 4's gate asks for 10,000 shadow games of the pool. `ShadowGamesTest` recorded seeds 100000–109999 with the 42
school decks and the 24 meta decks (`Mage.Server/career-src/pioneer`, `standard`, `shadow-decks/meta`), each game a
pair picked from the seed (the pairing is in [#289](https://github.com/arcanite24/playmat/issues/289)), in 12
parallel workers; `-Dxmage.shadowGames.seeds=a,b,c` records chosen seeds again.

| | First pass (11 Nov) | After #289's fixes (12 Nov) |
|---|---|---|
| Match | 9,901 | 9,949 |
| Differ | 54 ([#289](https://github.com/arcanite24/playmat/issues/289)) | 6, each a Java bug (below) |
| Skipped | 45: Java didn't finish them (44 timeouts, 1 executor error) | 45, the same |

The 12 Nov count replays the same recordings, except the five Urborg-and-manland seeds (100961, 103300, 104823, 107492,
109828), recorded again once `DecisionLog` could name their mana ability (below). 37 games of the run are checked in
under `shadow/gate10k` (trace texts stripped), one for each fix.

What the 54 were:

- **Engine bugs, fixed:** Nykthos's devotion and Sunken Citadel's mana in the playable check (a conditional pool entry
  is a source per mana); Urborg's land types on a Mutavault that turned back into a land, and Leyline of the Guildpact
  under Urborg or an Aura's grant; a token copy "except it's a 4/4" keeps no ability that sets its power and toughness
  (Tarmogoyf under The Scarab God, 707.9d); a token put into a library ceases to exist (Floodpits Drowner); "whenever an
  opponent loses life" needs its source still on the battlefield; an Aura goes to the graveyard right after the
  creature before it; a Class keeps its level after it leaves; ward's "sacrifice three" is checked before the player is
  asked; Authority of the Consuls and Giada are both replacement effects, so the player orders them; Teferi's untaps;
  Master of Barbs counts each painland's damage on its own; mobilize and blitz sacrifices are fixed targets, so their
  triggers aren't merged; double-faced cards' triggers go after the other cards'; an effect that lets you cast a card
  offers both halves of an adventurer; a token's token takes its image from the source token's set (no random draw for
  Fable's Treasures, the five "random draws part" games).
- **Recorder:** Urborg gives a land its {T}: Add {B} again, with a new id, each time effects apply, so the id Java
  picked was gone by the time `DecisionLog` named it (`?uuid`). `GameImpl.fireGetChoiceEvent` now tells `DecisionLog`
  what was offered, and a pick it can't place is named by its source and that ability's place (`B13a3`). The "Select a
  Jace card" refs were right: Java keeps Theorist's Sanctum in the hand while its behold is asked, and the replay now
  reads hand refs that way.
- **Java bugs, Rust keeps the rules (6 games):**
  - Fatehold Charm targeting itself (101145, 103122). "Return target spell or creature to its owner's hand" lets Java
    pick the charm: in 103122 answer 70 picks `S0`, and the only spell on the stack then (trace entry 121) is Fatehold
    Charm, which resolves by returning itself. 101145 does the same at answer 238. Rule 115.5 says a spell can't target
    itself, so Rust doesn't offer it: with one other target there is nothing to ask, Rust picks that one and the
    games part there. (When Java's prompt also had other targets, Rust still asks and takes Java's click on the
    charm, which is how tier 21's games match.)
  - A back face with mana value 0 (101918, 105704, 106208). Esper Origins put onto the battlefield transformed keeps
    `transformed=false` in Java's `PermanentCard` (its front is a sorcery), so `getManaValue` reads the back face's
    empty cost: Summon: Esper Maduin is 0, and March of Otherworldly Light with X=0 can exile it. Rule 712.8e makes it
    the front's 2. `PermanentToken.getManaValue` has the same bug for a copy token's back face (Graveyard Trespasser
    under The Scarab God, which Fatal Push kills in the first recording of 109828).
  - The hand's order after Accumulate Wisdom (106683). `Target.java` collects the cards to choose from with
    `Collectors.toSet()`, so the three cards go to the hand in the order of their random ids; answer 298 names `H1.3`,
    a different card in each engine. `LinkedHashSet` there would fix Java.

  Accepted as Java bugs on 12 Nov: Rust keeps the rules and the gate counts these 6 as Java's. If Rust ever had to
  copy Java in any of them, it's a small change in Rust.
- **Java recording differently each time.** Recording a seed twice can part (100961 split at answer 201, a
  PICK_TARGET): the driver picks among random UUIDs, whose order changes between runs. A recording replays the same
  every time, but a seed recorded again is a new game.

## State

`Game` is a set of copy-on-write parts (`Arc` + `Arc::make_mut`): players, objects, zones, the stack, combat, effects.
Copying a game for an AI search node bumps a few reference counts; a move pays only for the parts it changes. Objects
are numbered (`ObjId`) in the order they're created, which also fixes the order in which zones list them.

Card definitions (`CardDef`) are shared and never change. A card's abilities are data: each ability and effect is
tagged with the name of the Java framework class it mirrors (`DamageTargetEffect`, `EntersBattlefieldTriggeredAbility`,
`TargetCreaturePermanent`…), with that class's constructor arguments as fields. Cards come from `cards/cards.json`,
generated from `Mage.Sets` by `rust/tools/transpile.py`. The transpiler takes each card's abilities in Java's order,
with Java's rule texts, from `cards/facts.json`: decision logs name abilities by that order, and abilities on the stack
show those texts. `CardFactsTest` (Mage.Tests) writes the facts for a pool of names, one per line
(`-Dxmage.cardFacts=<out> -Dxmage.cardFacts.pool=<names>`); the pool is `transpile.engine_pool()` (below). A card
the transpiler can't express isn't in the engine.

## Pool, gate and factory

Being in the engine and being trusted are kept apart.

- **The pool** (`transpile.engine_pool()`) is every card in the school and shadow decks plus every Pioneer-legal card,
  `cards/pioneer-pool.txt` (15,259 names: the core, expansion and supplemental Standard-legal sets from Return to
  Ravnica on, minus the bans). `facts.json` covers all of it, and `cards.json` holds every card of it the transpiler
  can express (6,826 on 12 Nov). A card whose JSON the engine can't load yet is left out of the engine with a warning
  in `lib.rs`'s test, unless it's verified, which fails the test.
- **The gate** is `cards/verified.txt`, one name per line: the cards whose shadow games match Java. A game goes to
  Rust (the Rust AI's copy, `RustAi`, and the host, `RustHost`, both through `playmat-ai-bridge --check`; and
  `HostedGame::start` itself) only when every card of both decks is on it. The 881 cards of the phase 4 gate run
  started it. Shadow replays (`tests/shadow.rs`) and `ai-bench` take any card in the engine: that's how a card gets
  verified.
- **Views.** `cards/views.json` (docs/rust/Views.md) needs a template for every verified card, not for the whole pool:
  only verified cards reach a player's screen. Regenerate it when the list grows.

To regenerate after the pool or the Java cards change (in this order; the files are generated, so on a merge conflict
regenerate them rather than merge by hand, and `site/rust/progress.json` with `progress.py`):

    python3 rust/tools/transpile.py --write-facts-pool /tmp/facts-pool.txt
    mvn -o -q -pl Mage.Tests test -Dtest=CardFactsTest -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false \
      -Dxmage.cardFacts=$PWD/rust/crates/playmat-engine/cards/facts.json -Dxmage.cardFacts.pool=/tmp/facts-pool.txt
    python3 rust/tools/transpile.py --report /tmp/report.txt

## Rules, in order of work

1. Turns and steps, priority with the human skip rules, playing lands, mana abilities and paying costs, casting
   spells, the stack and resolution, drawing, state-based actions, the game's end.
2. Combat: declaring attackers and blockers, first strike, damage, the keywords that change combat.
3. Targets, triggered abilities (enters, attacks, dies, landfall), replacement effects (enters tapped), continuous
   effects in layer order, counters, tokens.
4. The rest of the pool's framework classes, then its 88 cards with their own effect classes.

## Toggles

Games go to this engine through the Rust AI and the Rust host (docs/rust/Ai.md, GameHost.md), only when every card of
both decks is verified (above); kill switch `XMAGE_ENGINE=java`.
