# Rust rules engine

Migration phase 4 (docs/RustMigration.md, issue #187): a rules engine in Rust for two-player duels with the Pioneer and
Standard Career school decks, built for the AI's search. Code: `rust/crates/playmat-engine`.

## What it has to match

Java stays the oracle. A **shadow game** is a game Java played: the decks, the state when the first player gets
priority (libraries top first, hands, the game's random state), every answer the players gave from then on, and the
trace (a state fingerprint at each priority and each resolution, [StateFingerprint.md](StateFingerprint.md)). The Rust
engine starts from the same state, gives the same answers to the same questions, and must give the same trace.

- `ShadowGamesTest` (Mage.Tests) records them: two human seats answered by the seeded `RandomDriver`, which picks what a
  client could send (lands, spells, targets, mana sources, attacks, blocks). The answers are the decision log's
  ([StateFingerprint.md](StateFingerprint.md), "Decision logs"): objects named by zone and position.
- `cargo test -p playmat-engine --test shadow` replays every game under `rust/crates/playmat-engine/shadow/` and fails
  if one differs. With `PLAYMAT_SHADOW=<dir>` it replays that folder instead and only reports (add
  `PLAYMAT_SHADOW_STRICT=1` to fail): per game, the first trace entry that differs, with Java's and Rust's texts.
  Games with a card the engine doesn't have, and games Java didn't finish (timeouts), are skipped.

Recording games (Mage.Tests; `mvn -o -q install -pl Mage -DskipTests` first if Mage changed):

    mvn -o -pl Mage.Tests test -Dtest=ShadowGamesTest -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false \
      -Dxmage.shadowGames=<out dir> -Dxmage.shadowGames.games=30 \
      -Dxmage.shadowGames.decks=$PWD/rust/crates/playmat-engine/shadow-decks/tier1 \
      -Dxmage.dataCollectors.printGameLogs=false -Dlog4j.configuration=file:$PWD/.travis/log4j.properties

Without `.decks` it plays the Pioneer and Standard school decks. The checked-in games have their trace texts removed
to keep them small; a recording keeps them, which is what the difference report prints.

`HumanDialogs.md` is the question-by-question reference for what `HumanPlayer` asks.

## Where it stands

| Tier | Decks | Shadow games |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shadow-decks/tier1`: basic lands, vanilla and keyword creatures (flying, reach, vigilance, trample, lifelink), mana elves, burn | 69 of 69 finished games match (15 checked in, 3 with combat damage splits) |
| 2 | `shadow-decks/tier2`: enters and attack triggers, until-end-of-turn and static boosts, destroy, counterspells, enters-tapped and dual lands, first and double strike | 30 of 30 match (11 checked in) |

A full game replays in about 2.5 ms (release build). Known gaps: cleanup never gives priority, and a player's
triggers are ordered by a question only when they differ (not yet seen in a shadow game).

## State

`Game` is a set of copy-on-write parts (`Arc` + `Arc::make_mut`): players, objects, zones, the stack, combat, effects.
Copying a game for an AI search node bumps a few reference counts; a move pays only for the parts it changes. Objects
are numbered (`ObjId`) in the order they're created, which also fixes the order in which zones list them.

Card definitions (`CardDef`) are shared and never change. A card's abilities are data: each ability and effect is
tagged with the name of the Java framework class it mirrors (`DamageTargetEffect`, `EntersBattlefieldTriggeredAbility`,
`TargetCreaturePermanent`…), with that class's constructor arguments as fields. Cards come from `cards/*.json`,
generated from `Mage.Sets` by `rust/tools/transpile.py`. The transpiler takes each card's abilities in Java's order,
with Java's rule texts, from `cards/facts.json`: decision logs name abilities by that order, and abilities on the stack
show those texts. `CardFactsTest` (Mage.Tests) writes the facts for a pool of names, one per line
(`-Dxmage.cardFacts=<out> -Dxmage.cardFacts.pool=<names>`); the pool is every card in the school decks and the
shadow decks (`transpile.school_pool()`). a card the transpiler can't express isn't in the engine, and
a game with it isn't routed to Rust.

## Rules, in order of work

1. Turns and steps, priority with the human skip rules, playing lands, mana abilities and paying costs, casting
   spells, the stack and resolution, drawing, state-based actions, the game's end.
2. Combat: declaring attackers and blockers, first strike, damage, the keywords that change combat.
3. Targets, triggered abilities (enters, attacks, dies, landfall), replacement effects (enters tapped), continuous
   effects in layer order, counters, tokens.
4. The rest of the pool's framework classes, then its 88 cards with their own effect classes.

## Toggles

Nothing routes games to this engine yet. Routing (`engine = java|rust|auto` per table, `auto` only when every card of
both decks is in the engine, kill switch `XMAGE_ENGINE=java`) comes after the shadow gate in issue #187.
